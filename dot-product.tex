\papertitle{The Dot Product}

\paperheading{Summary}

\noindent
The dot product of two vectors $\sv a$ and $\sv b$ is defined as
$$
\sv a * \sv b = a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z
$$
The dot product has the property that
$$
\sv a * \sv b = ab * \cos\theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\sv a$ and $\sv b$.

\paperheading{Discovery}

\noindent
We know from the law of cosines that for a triangle with sides
$a$, $b$, and $c$ we will hold to the relation
$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2\? ab \cos\theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between sides $a$ and $b$. Yet, if we
allow this triangle to live in an $n$-dimensional space where $n \ge
2$ then we can represent it with the vectors $\sv a$, $\sv b$, and
$\sv c = \sv b - \sv a$. The squared length of $\sv c$ will be
$$
\eqalign{
\sv c^2
= \(\sv b - \sv a\)^2
&=
\(b_x - a_x\)^2 + \(b_y - a_y\)^2 + \(b_z - a_z\)^2
\cr
&=
\(b_x^2 - 2\?b_xa_x + a_x^2\) + \(b_y^2 - 2\?b_ya_y + a_y^2\) + \(b_z^2 - 2\?b_za_z + a_z^2\) \cr
&=
a^2 + b^2 -2\(a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z\)
}
$$
Setting this result equal to $c^2$ from before shows us that
$$
ab * \cos\theta = a_x b_x + a_y b_y + a_z b_z
$$
We define this quantity to be the dot product of $\sv a$ and $\sv b$
$$
\sv a * \sv b = ab * \cos\theta = a_x b_x + a_y b_y + a_z b_z
$$
