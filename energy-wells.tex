\papertitle{Harmonic Oscillation in Energy Wells}

\paperheading{Summary}

An object sitting at the bottom of an energy well, when slightly perturbed,
will experience harmonic oscillation about the bottom of the well. If the
bottom of the well is at $x_0$ then the frequency of the oscillation will be
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\left.\q{1}{m}\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}}
$$

\paperheading{Discovery}

Consider some potential energy function $U(x)$. Let us take a Taylor expansion
of this function about some point $x_0$:
$$
U(x)
=
U(x_0)
+ \left.\q{\partial U}{\partial x}\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0)
+ \left.\q12\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0)^2
+ {\cal O}\Bigl((x-x_0)^3\Bigr)
$$
If we take $x_0$ to be a local minimum of $U(x)$ then we must have
$$
\left.\q{\partial U}{\partial x}\right|_{x_0} = 0
\hskip18pt
\left.\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0} \ge 0
$$
This reduces the Taylor expansion to
$$
U(x)
=
U(x_0)
+ \left.\q12\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0)^2
+ {\cal O}\Bigl((x-x_0)^3\Bigr)
$$
If we also stipulate that $x$ never strays too far from $x_0$ then we can
throw away higher order terms in $x - x_0$. The potential is now just
$$
U(x)
=
U(x_0)
+ \left.\q12\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0)^2
$$
We can get the related force by taking the negated gradient:
$$
F(x)
=
-\left.\q{\p}{\p x}\middle[U(x)\right]
=
-\left.\q{\p}{\p x}\middle[
U(x_0)
+ \left.\q12\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0)^2
\right]
=
\left.-\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0)
$$
In summary we have
$$
F(x)
=
\left.-\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}(x - x_0)
$$
It might feel odd that this force seems to depend on the negated {\it second}
derivative of $U$, when forces typically depend on negated {\it first}
derivatives of $U$. The key point here is that we are using $U''(x_0)$ as a
constant, so this is nothing like the usual relationship $\sv F = -\nabla U$.
Since $U''(x_0) \ge 0$ this equation of motion is clearly a harmonic
oscillation with angular frequency
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\left.\q1m\q{\partial^2 U}{{\partial x}^2}\right|_{x_0}}
$$
We have thus shown that an object sitting at the bottom of an energy well,
when slightly perturbed, will experience harmonic motion about the bottom of
the well.
